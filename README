Prerequisites:
MongoDB (tested with 1.4.3)
PyMongo
Pylons (tested with 1.0)

The contents of pylons will not work standalone. They have to be placed in an existing pylons installation in order to serve content.

The scripts in tools/buildtest will preload the MongoDB with test data in the expected schema.
